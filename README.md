# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to learn how to create data frames and graphs using jupyter notebook/ pandas. By using a combinations of lists, series, and data frames, were were able to gather data from two Microsoft excel sheets in order to combine two data sets (one for cities and one for rides) and extrapolate data from them. The data was split into three groups based on the city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) and data was collected in terms of the total amount fo rides, the total drivers, the total fares, and the average fares per ride and per driver (Figure 1).
## Results
The differences in the ride sharing data were as follows:
* Most rides were conducted in the urban citites, followed by Suburban and Rural
* Most drivers were in urban cities as well, followed by Suburban and Rural
* The highest total amount of fares were in Urban cities, followed by Suburban and Rural
* The lowest fare per ride was in Urban cities, followed by Rural and Suburban
* The lowest fare per driver was in Urban cities, followed by Suburban and Rural
All the data and exact values are shown in the table in Figure 2.

## Summary
In Summation, Urban riders get the most value as they have the most rides and the lowest fare per ride.
Three business recommendations would be:
1. Decrease the cost of fares for riders in Rural areas, as they have the least amount of riders in their cities
2. decrease the average fair for Suburban cities, as they have the most expesnive average fare per ride of the three city types
3. Paying the drivers in Urban cities more would help workers the most, as Urban cities are the oly city where the average fare per ride is more than the average fare for driver
